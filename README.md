# DesignBlocks

Based on the toy [Design Blocks](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0279/6945/products/design-blocks-16-color-cubes-block-puzzle-3_1024x1024.jpg?v=1395690897)
I made this simple game for my daughter because she loves creating patterns with the blocks and I thought "Why not start teaching her computer skills with something she likes?"
There are no set goals or pointing system; it's just a free form game with no stress.

The controls are simple:
- Left click: "turn" the "block" (change the colour of the block)
- Right click: rotate the block horizontally
- Middle click: exit the game

When exiting the game asks you whether you want to save your design. The "load" function hasn't been implemented yet but you can still save your creation and one day you will beable to see it again ;)

Future plans: I want to add a feature where you can print out your design.
